# #168 MiniCore with ATMega328PB
#### Boost your standard Arduino UNO by adding this 328PB chip on a tiny PCB

### $2 for PCB Prototype ANY COLOUR https://jlcpcb.com
#### Layer: 1-2 Layer Size: 100mmx100mm
#### Bring your designs to fruition faster and easier than before
##### Free you to focus on your innovations and business.

So you have an Arduino UNO with a DIP chip ATMega328P, right? Then add this tiny PCB with a new ATMega328PB chip on it and get more features, such as:

* between 2 and 4 extra GPIO pins
* an extra SPI channel
* an extra I2C channel
* an extra USART (Serial1.print() etc)
* Totally 100% compatible with all your existing Arduino code

Install the **MiniCore  hardware core** (links below) and you can exploit the new chip, including some extra commands that added to the underlying Arduino infrastructure since it went live but were never included!

I demo a quick I2C LCD screen (I had to make some changes to one of the Liquid Crystal libraries as it was hardcoded to use the standard I2C (aka Wire.h) library) but it all worked very well.  

The PCB is simple (one SMD LQFP-32 chip and two 0603 100nF caps) and some header pins and you're done!  

### You don't have an UNO with a removable DIP chip?
No worries! You can pick one up very easily for the price of... yes, you've guessed it, a couple of coffees!  

Full details in the video of what you need to do, but it really is childsplay!
